=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a L<Moose role|Moose::Role> which implements running a program
in a pty while being able to filter the data that goes into and out of it. This
can be used to alter the inputs and outputs of a terminal based program (as in
the L</SYNOPSIS>), or to intercept the data going in or out to record it or
rebroadcast it (L<App::Ttyrec> or L<App::Termcast>, for instance).

This role is intended to be consumed by a class which implements its callbacks
as methods; for a simpler callback-based API, you may want to use
L<Term::Filter::Callback> instead.

=cut

subtype     'Term::Filter::TtyFileHandle',
    as      'FileHandle',
    where   { -t $_ },
    message { "Term::Filter requires input and output filehandles to be attached to a terminal" };

=attr input

The input filehandle to attach to the pty's input. Defaults to STDIN.

=cut

has input => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Term::Filter::TtyFileHandle',
    lazy    => 1,
    builder => '_build_input',
);

sub _build_input { \*STDIN }

=attr output

The output filehandle to attach the pty's output to. Defaults to STDOUT.

=cut

has output => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Term::Filter::TtyFileHandle',
    lazy    => 1,
    builder => '_build_output',
);

sub _build_output { \*STDOUT }

=method input_handles

Returns the filehandles which will be monitored for reading. This list defaults
to C<input> and C<pty>.

=cut

=method add_input_handle($fh)

Add an input handle to monitor for reading. After calling this method, the
C<read> callback will be called with C<$fh> as an argument whenever data is
available to be read from C<$fh>.

=cut

=method remove_input_handle($fh)

Remove C<$fh> from the list of input handles being watched for reading.

=cut

    traits   => ['Array'],
    isa      => 'ArrayRef[FileHandle]',

        [ $self->_grep_input_handles(sub { $_ != $fh }) ]
    );
}

=attr pty

The L<IO::Pty::Easy> object that the subprocess will be run under. Defaults to
a newly created instance.

        }
    },
);

=method run(@cmd)

Run the command specified by C<@cmd>, as though via C<system>. The callbacks
that have been defined will be called at the appropriate times, to allow for
manipulating the data that is sent or received.

=head1 CALLBACKS

The following methods may be defined to interact with the subprocess:

=over 4

=item setup

Called when the process has just been started. The parameters to C<run> are
passed to this callback.

=item cleanup

Called when the process terminates. Will not be called if C<setup> is never run
(for instance, if the process fails to start).

=item munge_input

Called whenever there is new data coming from the C<input> handle, before it is
passed to the pty. Must return the data to send to the pty (and the default
implementation does this), but can do other things with the data as well.

=item munge_output

Called whenever the process running on the pty has produced new data, before it
is passed to the C<output> handle. Must return the data to send to the
C<output> handle (and the default implementation does this), but can do other
things with the data as well.

=item read

Called when a filehandle other than C<input> or C<pty> has data available (so
will never be called unless you call C<add_input_handle> to register your
handle with the event loop). Receives the handle with data available as its
only argument.

=item read_error

Called when an exception state is detected in any handle in C<input_handles>
(including the default ones). Receives the handle with the exception state as
its only argument.

=item winch

Called whenever the parent process receives a C<SIGWINCH> signal, after it
propagates that signal to the subprocess. C<SIGWINCH> is sent to a process
running on a terminal whenever the dimensions of that terminal change. This
callback can be used to update any other handles watching the subprocess about
the new terminal size.
